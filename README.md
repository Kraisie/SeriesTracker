# Series-Tracker

## ToDo-List
* Implement all functions of menu bar
    * Settings (get stored in file)
        * Custom Pictures (check pxSize)
        * Path for BackUp and cycle in that BackUps gets created 
    * Help
        * "How To"/Tutorial
            * Description of all Functions

## Think-Abouts
* API for movies or remove movies as it gets far too chaotic when adding every single movie (even when it is me who does not watch a lot of movies)
    * Maybe just add Movies that you want to see in the future and delete them after you saw them
