## Serien-Tracker

### Track your series.

#### ToDo-List

* Average time of a episode to get an amount of wasted time (Info-Table)
* Description of series for Info-Table
    * Program that changes old Series.json to a json that has space for a description
* Sort series after percentage of completion
* Menubar on top to switch to movies (not implemented yet), or open the settings (not implemented)
    * Settings with path where to save the .json-file and maybe own background-pics
* Implement Series-API of TVDB to make everything easier and get most information automatically
* Check every period of time if there are new episodes/seasons of a series
    * Period changeable in Settings

#### Think-Abouts

* Server for Webapp (change whole programm to a Spring Webapp) and run it on server for access from everywhere on series
* BackUp of .json to Server, not just external drive (for me)
* Linux-Support regarding Paths etc.
